# FunctionPlotter

FunctionPlotter is a Python-based graphical application designed to allow users to visualize mathematical functions. Built using PySide2 and Matplotlib, this tool provides an interactive environment to plot, zoom, and analyze function graphs dynamically.

## Features

- **Interactive Plotting**: Users can input any mathematical function (e.g., `5*x^3 + 2*x`) to see its graph.
- **Zoom and Pan**: The application includes a toolbar for zooming and panning, helping users explore details of the graph.
- **Input Validation**: Inputs are validated to ensure only correct mathematical expressions and numeric values are accepted.
- **Error Handling**: Provides user-friendly notifications for incorrect inputs or errors during the plotting process.
